# 3D-plots
A sample of 3D plots that I have created throughout my PhD. Please note that a number of these plots have been simplified for the purpose of the reader from those included in my pulications.

The following scripts are included:

3d_contour_plot.py: Plotting 3D data using contours. Contours were preferred over a surface, for example, in this case, because it is easier for the reader to see how the data varies in 3D. 

3d_cone_wireframe.py: Plotting a cone (pointy end up) using a wireframe plot. Designed to show how a lava dome is simulated in our numerical modelling. The height of the dome increasing through time as a function of the volume of lava that has extruded from the volume. We assume that the dip angle of the dome remains constant as the dome grows, a reasonable assumption based on observations.
